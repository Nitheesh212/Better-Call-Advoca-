section 69A of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 (4 of 1882), any security interest created in favour of 
any secured creditor may be enforced, without the intervention of court or tribunal, by such creditor in 
accordance with the provisions of this Act. 

(2) Where any borrower, who is under a liability to a secured creditor under a security agreement, 
makes any default in repayment of secured debt or any instalment thereof, and his account in respect of 
such debt is classified by the secured creditor as non-performing asset, then, the secured creditor may 
require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge in full his liabilities to the secured creditor within 
sixty days from the date of notice failing which the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any 
of the rights under sub-section (4). 

1[Provided that— 

(i) the requirement of classification of secured debt as non-performing asset under this  
sub-section shall not apply to a borrower who has raised funds through issue of debt securities; and 

(ii) in the event of default, the debenture trustee shall be entitled to enforce security interest in the 
same manner as provided under this section with such modifications as may be necessary and in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of security documents executed in favour of the debenture 
trustee.] 

(3) The notice referred to in sub-section (2) shall give details of the amount payable by the borrower 
and the secured assets intended to be enforced by the secured creditor in the event of non-payment of 
secured debts by the borrower. 

2[(3A) If, on receipt of the notice under sub-section (2), the borrower makes any representation or 
raises any objection, the secured creditor shall consider such representation or objection and if the secured 
creditor comes to the conclusion that such representation or objection is not acceptable or tenable, he shall 
communicate 3[within fifteen days] of receipt of such representation or objection the reasons for                   
non-acceptance of the representation or objection to the borrower: 

Provided that the reasons so communicated or the likely action of the secured creditor at the stage of 
communication of reasons shall not confer any right upon the borrower to prefer an application to the 
Debts Recovery Tribunal under section 17 or the Court of District Judge under section 17A.] 

(4) In case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified in  
sub-section (2), the secured creditor may take recourse to one or more of the following measures to 
recover his secured debt, namely:— 

(a) take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of 
lease, assignment or sale for realising the secured asset; 

4[(b) take over the management of the business of the borrower including the right to transfer by 
way of lease, assignment or sale for realising the secured asset:

17 
 



Provided that the right to transfer by way of lease, assignment or sale shall be exercised only 
where the substantial part of the business of the borrower is held as security for the debt: 

Provided further that where the management of whole of the business or part of the business is 
severable, the secured creditor shall take over the management of such business of the borrower 
which is relatable to the security for the debt;] 

(c) appoint any person (hereafter referred to as the manager), to manage the secured assets the 
possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor; 

(d) require at any time by notice in writing, any person who has acquired any of the secured 
assets from the borrower and from whom any money is due or may become due to the borrower, to 
pay the secured creditor, so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt. 

(5) Any payment made by any person referred to in clause (d) of sub-section (4) to the secured 
creditor shall give such person a valid discharge as if he has made payment to the borrower. 

1[(5A) Where the sale of an immovable property, for which a reserve price has been specified, has 
been postponed for want of a bid of an amount not less than such reserve price, it shall be lawful for any 
officer of the secured creditor, if so authorised by the secured creditor in this behalf, to bid for the 
immovable property on behalf of the secured creditor at any subsequent sale. 

(5B) Where the secured creditor, referred to in sub-section (5A), is declared to be the purchaser of the 
immovable property at any subsequent sale, the amount of the purchase price shall be adjusted towards 
the amount of the claim of the secured creditor for which the auction of enforcement of security interest is
